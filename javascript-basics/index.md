## 1. Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, every student should be able to:

* Explain what JavaScript is and where it runs
* Understand what variables are and why we need them
* Create variables using `let` and `const`
* Use different data types: strings, numbers, and booleans
* Display output using `console.log`
* Combine strings using concatenation
* Run JavaScript programs using Node.js
* Create a personalized, dynamic story
* Save and share their code using Git

This workshop is about building your first real programs and seeing your creativity come to life in code.

## 2. Success Definition

A student is successful if they can say:

> "I can write code that stores information in variables and displays my own creative output. I'm not afraid to experiment and debug."

## 3. Environment & Prerequisites

### Required Software

Before the workshop, students should have:

* **Node.js 18+** installed (see [Setup Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/SETUP))
* **VS Code** installed and configured
* **Git** installed and configured
* **GitHub account** created
* **Workshop repository forked** - or if you already have a fork from a previous workshop, [sync your fork]({{ site.baseurl }}/SETUP#section-4-cloning-the-workshop-repository) to get the latest materials

See the complete [Setup Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/SETUP) for step-by-step installation instructions.

### Primary Path

* Local development using VS Code
* Node.js in integrated terminal
* Git for version control

### Fallback Path (If Needed)

* GitHub Codespaces (browser-based; be mindful of [free quota](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces#free-quota) limits)

## 4. 2-Hour Agenda (Minute-by-Minute)

### 0:00–0:10 - Welcome & Code Confidence Icebreaker

> Low-pressure, creativity-focused

* Prompt (verbal or written):
  * > "If you could program a robot to do one task for you, what would it be?"
* Emphasize:
  * Everyone is learning
  * Mistakes are how we learn coding
  * Your code will be unique and that's perfect

### 0:10–0:25 - Environment Setup & Git Fork/Clone

> Hands-on setup

* Navigate to workshop repository on GitHub
* Fork the repository
* Clone to local machine
* Open in VS Code
* Verify Node.js: `node --version`
* Run starter: `node hello.js`

### 0:25–0:45 - JavaScript & Your First Variables

> Foundation concepts

Topics:

* What is JavaScript and where does it run?
* What is Node.js and why are we using it?
* Variables are labeled boxes for information
* `let` for changeable values, `const` for constants
* Data types: strings (text), numbers, booleans (true/false)

Activity:

* Create variables about yourself:

```javascript
let studentName = "Alex";
let favoriteNumber = 7;
const isLearningJavaScript = true;
```

* Use console.log to display values

### 0:45–1:05 - Console.log and String Concatenation

> Making output interesting

Topics:

* console.log displays information
* Use `+` to combine strings
* Mix variables and text for messages
* Mind the spaces when concatenating

Activity:

* Build personalized messages:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, my name is " + studentName);
console.log("My favorite number is " + favoriteNumber);
console.log("Learning JavaScript: " + isLearningJavaScript);
```

### 1:05–1:15 - Break

* Encourage movement
* Optional: coding riddle on screen

### 1:15–1:25 - Introduction to the Dynamic Story Project

> Preview and planning

* Show completed example (run `story-example.js`)
* Explain the mission: creative storytelling with variables
* Walk through starter template
* Clarify: we build incrementally, simple to complex

### 1:25–1:45 - Hands-On: Building the Dynamic Story

> Creative coding time

Progression:

1. Add 3-4 story variables
2. Display story opening with console.log
3. Add more variables and story development
4. Create story ending using all variables
5. Test by running `node story.js`

Extension for fast finishers:

* Add math operators to track scores
* Create longer, more complex narratives
* Use `let` to change values through the story
* Experiment with boolean variables

### 1:45–1:55 - Git Commit, Push & Show and Tell

> Save and celebrate

* Add and commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Complete dynamic story"`
* Push to GitHub: `git push`
* Volunteer show-and-tell (2-3 students)
* Celebrate creativity and problem-solving

### 1:55–2:00 - Wrap-Up & Teaser

> Reflect and connect forward

* Reflection: "What surprised you about JavaScript?"
* Preview: "Next workshop, your code will respond to button clicks in the browser!"
* Quick demo of HTML + JavaScript interaction

## 5. Printed Student Handouts

### Handout 1: Vocabulary (Fill-in-the-Blank)

* JavaScript, Node.js, variable, let, const
* string, number, boolean
* console.log, concatenation, operator

### Handout 2: Mission Worksheet

* Warm-up check-in
* JavaScript basics concepts
* Variable lab exercises
* Data types detective
* Console.log practice
* Story planning zone
* Terminal commands reference
* Reflection prompts

## 6. Instructor Guardrails

* Type slowly - narrate what you're doing
* Normalize syntax errors: "I make these mistakes daily"
* Ask "What do you think the computer thinks?" when students are stuck
* Don't type for students - guide them to find their own answers
* Celebrate attempts, not just correct answers
* Read error messages together - they're helpful!

## 7. Bridge to Workshop #3 (Interactive HTML + JavaScript)

End with:

> "Today you made JavaScript display information. Next workshop, you'll make JavaScript respond to real button clicks and form inputs. Your variables will store data from users!"

Quick demo:

```html
<button onclick="greet()">Click Me!</button>
<script>
  function greet() {
    alert("Hello from JavaScript!");
  }
</script>
```

## 8. Overarching Goals

* Variables as the foundation of all programming
* Console.log as your debugging superpower
* Creativity over perfection
* Comfort with terminal and Node.js
* Building blocks for interactive programming
* Confidence to experiment and learn from errors
