# Youth Tech Workshops – Design Charter

## Overview

A series of five 2-hour technology workshops for students ages **12–14** with minimal prior programming experience. Workshops mix instruction and hands-on work, slightly build on one another, but are designed to be **primarily independent** so students may join at any point.

**Branding:** Lansing Tech Studio  \
**Theme:** Robot persona ("Lansing Techster" or just "Techster") is learning alongside students, and they help each other figure things out. \
**Platforms:** Windows laptops (primary), Chromebooks (secondary)

## Workshops

1. [Tech Fundamentals]({{ site.baseurl }}/tech-fundamentals/) – 1/15/2026
2. JavaScript Basics – 1/22/2026
3. Interactive HTML + JavaScript – 2/5/2026
4. Python Coding Introduction – 2/19/2026
5. Advanced Python Coding – 4/2/2026

## 1. Learning Environment & Tooling

### Internet & Platforms

- Unrestricted internet access during workshops
- GitHub, Replit, Codespaces, and similar platforms are allowed

### Accounts

- Students use **personal GitHub accounts**
- No COPPA or parental consent constraints

### Tooling Strategy

- **Local installs preferred** (Node.js, Python)
- **Web-based tools are a fallback** (specifically GitHub Codespaces), not the primary path
- Chromebooks may use Linux (Crostini) or browser-based tools if needed
- Assume **somewhat slow internet**

---

## 2. Success Criteria

### Tech Fundamentals Workshop

Students will:

- Create and log into a GitHub account
- Use a multi-device password manager
- Run basic Bash commands
- Make a git commit
- Open a pull request to a shared **"Hall of Champions"** file

### All Other Workshops

Students will:

- Fork the starter repository
- Make multiple commits and pushes
- Complete a minimal working project
- Leave with documented "next steps" for independent learning

---

## 3. Instruction vs Hands-On Balance

- Early workshops: ~40% instruction / 60% hands-on
- Later workshops: ~20% instruction / 80% hands-on
- Ratio may shift dynamically based on student readiness

---

## 4. Curriculum Continuity

- Workshops may reference prior concepts but must stand alone
- Returning students may go deeper; newcomers complete a simpler path
- Later workshops include independent warm-up work to allow onboarding

---

## 5. GitHub Repository Structure

### Repository Model

- **Single public monorepo**
- One folder per workshop

### Git as a Learning Objective

Students are expected to:

- Clone repositories
- Fork repositories
- Commit and push regularly
- Open pull requests

### Required Materials per Workshop

- Student-facing README
- Slide deck
- Instructor notes / talk track
- Starter code
- Solution branches or equivalents
- Printed materials (PDF)

---

## 6. Printed Materials

- One packet per workshop
- Maximum **6 printed sheets**
- Includes:
  - Fill-in-the-blank notes
  - Diagrams
  - Puzzles
  - Reflection prompts

### Accessibility

- Minimum 14pt font
- Prefer OpenDyslexic when available
- Grayscale-friendly; color only when necessary

---

## 7. Classroom Management

### Pacing

- Fast finishers: extend or improve current work
- Students falling behind: focus on notes; follow up after workshop

### Collaboration

- Work designed for individual completion
- Pairing or small groups allowed when appropriate
- Peer help is encouraged

---

## 8. Python Workshop Standards

### Runtime

- Prefer local Python install
- Browser-based Python as fallback

### Python Intro

- Primarily standard library
- One small fun library allowed at the end if time permits

### Advanced Python

Includes:

- Functions
- Classes and modules
- Lists and dictionaries
- File I/O
- Passing functions as arguments
- Async programming
- Event-based programming
- Text-based games only (GUI referenced as optional self-learning)

---

## 9. Tone, Theme, and Motivation

### Robot Persona: Lansing Techster

- Curious, literal, encouraging
- Frames bugs as "sensor data"
- Workshops are framed as **missions** upgrading robot capabilities

### Assessment

- Demo and/or show-and-tell at the end of workshops
- Evaluation is voluntary and informal

---

## 10. Risk & Failure Handling

- Expect uneven pacing and technical hiccups
- Students should have pre-workshop setup access
- Activities must degrade gracefully
- Worst-case fallback: instructor acts as the "computer" using a whiteboard

---

## Guiding Principles

- Cut scope before cutting confidence
- Momentum over perfection
- Curiosity is success
- No student leaves feeling like the workshop failed
