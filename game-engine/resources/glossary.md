**GDScript:** Godot's Python-like scripting language.

**CharacterBody2D:** A node used for 2D characters that move and collide (player movement).

**Area2D:** A node used for detection (pickups, triggers, hitboxes). Often used for static power-ups.

**CollisionShape2D:** A node that defines the shape used for collisions.

**physics:** The part of the engine that simulates gravity and collisions.

**signal:** A message/event that nodes can send (like “coin collected”).

**AnimatedSprite2D:** A node that plays 2D sprite animations.

**animation:** A sequence of frames (idle, move, jump).

**velocity:** A vector that describes speed and direction (e.g., how fast the player is moving).

**is_on_floor():** A common way to check if the player is on the ground.
