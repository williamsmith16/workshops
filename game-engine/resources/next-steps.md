# Next Steps After Game Engine Tools

You built a tiny platformer in Godot. Here are good next steps.

## 1) Keep Building This Project

Pick one small upgrade:

- Add a second level (new scene)
- Add sound effects (jump, gem pickup)
- Add an enemy that patrols
- Add a "restart" button when you fall
- Add a main menu scene

You can find the instructions for how the starter project was made in [build-starter-project.md](../starter-code/build-starter-project.md).

## 2) Learn More Godot

- Read the official docs: <https://docs.godotengine.org/>
- Search terms that help:
  - "Godot 4 CharacterBody2D movement"
  - "Godot signals Area2D"
  - "Godot UI Label update"

## 3) Build a New Tiny Game

If you want a fresh start, try:

- A top-down gem collector
- A one-screen dodge game
- A simple platformer with one enemy

Rule: Keep it small enough to finish.
