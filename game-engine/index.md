## 1. Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, every student should be able to:

- Explain what **nodes** and **scenes** are in Godot
- Identify common node types used in 2D games (sprites, collisions, UI)
- Describe what **physics** does (gravity, collision, ground)
- Open and edit a **GDScript** file and run the game
- Add simple game features to a starter project:
  - Switch character animation: **idle / move / jump**
  - Flip the character horizontally based on direction faced
  - Add a score counter when collecting gems
  - (If time) Show a winner message after all gems are collected

## 2. Success Definition

A student is successful if they can say:

> "I can open a Godot project, find the right node, and change code so the game
> behaves differently."

## 3. Environment & Prerequisites

### Primary Path (Recommended)

- Use the **web editor**: <https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/>
  - If you haave a local install of Godot, you can use that instead.
- Download the starter project zip from this repo:
  - `game-engine/starter-code/platformer-starter-godot4.zip` (coming soon)

### Fallback Path

- Pair with another student who has Godot working
