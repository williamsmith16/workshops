# Common Questions & Friendly Answers

Use simple language first; add detail only if a student asks for more. Keep the
tone curious and encouraging; Techster is learning with them.

- **"What's the difference between hardware and software?"**  
  Hardware is what you can touch (keyboard, screen); software is the
  instructions that tell hardware what to do (apps, games, operating systems).

- **"Is the cloud hardware or software?"**  
  Both: the cloud is software running on hardware in someone else's building.
  You just access it over the internet.

- **"Why do file extensions matter?"**  
  They tell the computer what type of file it is and which programs can open
  it. Changing `.txt` to `.jpg` doesn't turn text into a picture.

- **"Why can't I use Word or Google Docs to code?"**  
  They add hidden formatting (fonts, bold, colors) that break code. Code needs
  plain text, so we use editors like Notepad or VS Code.

- **"What happens if I type the wrong terminal command?"**  
  Today's commands are safe (they just read or print). Mistakes usually give an
  error message-read it together and try again.

- **"What is code, really?"**  
  It's a set of precise instructions. Computers are literal, so we have to be
  specific about every step.

- **"What's a program?"**  
  Code saved together to do a job-like a browser, a game, or a calculator.

- **"Why learn the terminal?"**  
  It's a direct way to talk to the computer. It feels powerful and is faster
  for many tasks once you know a few commands.

- **"What's the difference between memory and storage?"**  
  Memory (RAM) is short-term and clears when you turn off the computer.
  Storage (drive or cloud) is long-term and keeps files until you delete them.

- **"Do I need to memorize commands?"**  
  Not yet. Keep the mini list: `pwd` (where am I?), `ls` (what's here?),
  `echo` (say something). Confidence first, speed later.
